# TruView

## Introduction
An app that allows a realtor/landlord user to post listings with a virtual tour of the space. An apartment hunter user can then view these virtual tours in the posted listing.

## User Stories

- **Realtor User** - Linda is a realtor who wants a way to accurately display her listings to prospective clients. With TruView is able to create a profile to organize all of her listings in one place. When Linda creates a listing she is not only able to enter the address and upload photos, she is able to create 720 degree virtual tours so clients get a true feeling for the listing. This reduces the number of viewings that do not turn into sales.

- **Apartment Hunter User** - Janice is hunting for her next apartment and  is frustrated that the apartments she goes to look nothing like the photos in the listing. TruView allows Janice to search apartments by neighborhood and walk herself through a virtual tour of that listing, so she knows what it looks like before ever stepping inside. She can then add that listing to her favorites to look back at later. Janice can step into viewings with confidence knowing that she is truly interested in this listing.

## Prototype Features

The ability to take and display 360 degree spherical images. Our hope is to embed a camera so all functionality can happen within the app. However, at the moment, the user will be directed to the Street View (Google) app to capture the spherical images.
